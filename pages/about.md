# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

I am a self-taught software engineer who thrives in an
environment with complex problems. I have been tinkering with
technology since I was 8 years old, learning scripting languages
on my dad’s old Mac.

As my curiosity has grown over the years, it has allowed me to
think beyond my role to propose system enhancements and
infrastructure innovations that creatively achieve business goals.

My unique business background has given me a competitive
advantage as a developer by connecting a deep understanding
of both business needs and technical implementation.
This knowledge has enabled me to build a strong foundation of
trust with my leaders, creating a path to architect solutions that
increase efficiency and explore new opportunities.
